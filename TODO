  * I _THINK_ the only thread hazard right now is the wait between
    epoll_wait and when it acquires the net lock. Some solution
    would be ideal. Maybe: Check using EPOLL_MOD to make sure it still
    exists?

WTF:
  * IAC: Figure out where the incorrect character count is coming from?
    send_ttype works but only if I send a space or two first. Why does
    send_ttype need to send that magic space?

  * Overflow event: Client/HTTP couldn't keep up with the incoming text
    from the server.

  * Logging

  * Clean shutdown.

  * fix: IE9 doesn't work? (Will Johansson) FIXED: Thanks, qa'toq@M*U*S*H

  * An initial update (-1 => updateCount) with world open events and
    writing all the events from the worlds, but not from the user.
