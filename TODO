TODO:

  * I _THINK_ the only thread hazard right now is the wait between
    epoll_wait and when it acquires the net lock. Some solution
    would be ideal.

  * An initial update (-1 => updateCount) with world open events and
    writing all the events from the worlds, but not from the user.

  * IAC: Figure out where the incorrect character count is coming from?
    send_ttype works but only if I send a space or two first.

  * Overflow event: Client/HTTP couldn't keep up with the incoming text
    from the server.
