TODO:

  * Getting real IP address of connections: X-FORWARDED-FOR

  * Accessing logs and files via http. - files done.

  * File API - partly done.

  * Logging API

  * Server preferences, for connecting to a given IP:port: Send REAL_IP,
    etc?

  * SSL connection to MU*s.

  * I _THINK_ the only thread hazard right now is the wait between
    epoll_wait and when it acquires the net lock. Some solution
    would be ideal. Maybe: Check using EPOLL_MOD to make sure it still
    exists?

WTF:
  * IAC: Figure out where the incorrect character count is coming from?
    send_ttype works but only if I send a space or two first. Why does
    send_ttype need to send that magic space?

DONE:
  * Overflow event: Client/HTTP couldn't keep up with the incoming text
    from the server.

  * Logging

  * Clean shutdown.

  * fix: IE9 doesn't work? (Will Johansson) FIXED: Thanks, qa'toq@M*U*S*H

  * An initial update (-1 => updateCount) with world open events and
    writing all the events from the worlds, but not from the user.

  * Change ansi.css and ansi2html to use classes, e.g:
    <span class="fgR bgR u h">

  * 256 colors
  
  * UTF-8 support

  * Guests

  * Mongoose is limiting writes in push(). Fix it, or change to non-mongoose?
    -- Changed mg_printf to use vasprintf instead of snprintf on a fixed
       buffer.

  * User API

  * Guest limitations

  * API callAction calls are not always arriving in order. jquery queue
    isn't working? Fix!

  * login and guest should check for extant session, and redirect if they
    exist.

  * Figure out wtf is going on with the IAC calls. Fixed - Thanks to
    Odin and buffering.

  * Logout.
