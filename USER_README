Banana expects a users/ directory

It contains directories named after users.

e.g:
  users/walker/

Contents of a user dir: (So far, only password.md5 is supported :D)

  password.md5: An md5sum of the user's password.
      echo -n 'password' > password.md5

  canguest: If it contains "yes", it means the user can guest.

  timeout: User's personal session timeout. Usually 120 seconds.

  files/: For the API.file.* read/write/etc.

  log/: For logging and API.log.* access.
