Banana expects a users/ directory

It contains directories named after users.

e.g:
  users/walker/

Contents of a user dir: (So far, only password.md5 is supported :D)

  password.md5: An md5sum of the user's password.
      echo -n 'password' | md5sum > password.md5

  can_guest: If it contains "yes", it means the user can guest.

  host: For guest accounts, it must exist: Contains host.domain.com 1234
        (host and port)

  guestcount: Contains a number, it is the number of the next guest
              to connect (assuming can_guest is enabled).

  client: Contains a path (not including the beginning /) of the preferred
          client of the user. e.g: "webcat", "oneworld", etc.

  timeout: Contains a number, which is the seconds this user can be
           disconnected from the server before their sessions time out.
           (Default 120 for users, 30 for guests)

  files/: For the API.file.* read/write/etc.
