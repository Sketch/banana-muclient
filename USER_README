Banana expects a users/ directory

It contains directories named after users.

e.g:
  users/walker/

Contents of a user dir: (So far, only password.md5 is supported :D)

  password.md5: An md5sum of the user's password.
      echo -n 'password' > password.md5

  can_guest: If it contains "yes", it means the user can guest.

  guestcount: Contains a number, it is the number of the next guest
              to connect (assuming can_guest is enabled).

  files/: For the API.file.* read/write/etc.

  logs/: For logging and API.log.* access.
